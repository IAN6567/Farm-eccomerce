# Farm Products E-Commerce Database

This project is a relational database schema designed to support a small-scale farm products e-commerce platform. It enables farmers and buyers to interact through a structured system that manages users, products, orders, inventory, payments, and shipping. The schema is tailored to rural contexts, especially in Nandi County, Kenya, where digital tools can enhance agricultural trade and logistics.

## Project Overview

The **Farm Products E-Commerce Database** is part of a capstone project integrating agriculture and technology. It reflects real-world needs in livestock and crop sales, customer management, and logistics. The database is built using SQL and visualized through an ERD diagram generated in DBeaver.
